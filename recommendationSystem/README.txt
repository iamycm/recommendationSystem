README for group projectDescriptions---------------This repository contains a Jupyter notebook, six json files of recommendation and six source datasets. Six source dataset including three main datasets and three optional sets related to books from the BX community. These source datasets include information about books, ratings given by users, and user details.# JUPYTER NOTEBOOK #
Project2.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook file contains a data analysis project that involves cleaning, exploring, and visualizing six source datasets. It also utilizes classification models(KNN and Decision Tree) to predict which publisher's books are more likely to receive higher ratings, as well as developing a recommendation system capable of predicting the ratings that users might assign to new books.
# JSON FILES #

Publishers_Recommend.json: Book publishers that are recommended to the bookstore.Publishers_not_Recommend.json: Book publishers that are not recommended to the bookstore.Books_Recommend_To_Bookstore.json: ISBN of books that are recommended to the bookstore.
Books_Not_Recommend_To_Bookstore.json: ISBN of books that are not recommended to the bookstore.
Books_Recommend_To_User_Itembased.json: ISBN of books that are not recommended to users generated by a item-based recommendation system.
Books_Recommend_To_User_Userbased.json: ISBN of books that are not recommended to users generated by a user-based recommendation system.# MAIN DATASETS #

Installing Python Environment----------------------------------------------
Here is a simple guide of installing Python environment on your own device.

1. **Download from Official Website**: Visit the [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python installer suitable for your operating system. (Note: We use 3.11.3 for our project)

2. **Run the Installer**: Double-click the downloaded installer and follow the prompts to install Python. During the installation process, make sure to check the "Add Python to PATH" option to easily use Python from the command line.

3. **Verify the Installation**: Once the installation is complete, open a command-line interface (Windows users can use PowerShell or Command Prompt, while Mac and Linux users can use Terminal) and enter the following command to verify if Python is successfully installed:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

If installed successfully, you will see the version of Python.

Running Jupyter Notebook Files
----------------------------------------------
This is a guide of how to run Jupyter Notebook files on your local machine.

Installation
- **Install Python**ï¼š Jupyter Notebook requires Python to be installed on your machine. If you haven't already installed Python, you can follow the instruction above.
- **Install Jupyter Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook can be installed using pip, the Python package installer. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```

Launching Jupyter Notebook
- **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**: Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.

- **Navigate to Project Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your Jupyter Notebook files are located.

- **Start Jupyter Notebook Server**: Once you are in the desired directory, run the following command to start the Jupyter Notebook server:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

- **Access Jupyter Notebook**: After running the command, Jupyter Notebook will start and open in your default web browser. You can now navigate to the directory where your Jupyter Notebook files are located and open them by clicking on the file name.

- **Usage Instructions**: - Execute each cell of code in the Notebook to view the results.
			  - Modify the code to fit different datasets or requirements.
			  - When importing datasets, ensure the file paths are correct.
- **Shut Down Jupyter Notebook**: Return to the terminal/command prompt where it is running and press `Ctrl + C`. Confirm that you want to shut down the server by entering `y`.

- [Jupyter Documentation](https://jupyter.org/documentation)
- [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)

If you encounter any issues or have questions about running Jupyter Notebook files, refer to the official documentation or search for solutions online.

Running Jupyter Notebook with Missing Libraries
----------------------------------------------
Sometimes you may not have the required modules installed in your environment. If you encounter a situation where you see "No module named <library_name>", you can try using the pip command to install the missing module. Here's a template to install required
Modules:

```bash
# Replace `<library_name>` with the name of the missing library.
pip install <library_name>
```
Subsampling from Large Datasets----------------------------------------------Working with large datasets can be computationally intensive. If you encounter performance issues, you can subsample the datasets to work with smaller portions. Here's a way to sensibly subsample the datasets:```python# Subsample from bookssubsample_books = books.sample(n=1000, random_state=42)# Get sampled ISBNssampled_isbns = subsample_books['ISBN']# Subsample from ratings based on sampled ISBNssubsample_ratings = ratings[ratings['ISBN'].isin(sampled_isbns)]# Get sampled User-IDs from subsample_ratingssampled_user_ids = subsample_ratings['User-ID']# Subsample from users based on sampled User-IDssubsample_users = users[users['User-ID'].isin(sampled_user_ids)]```Users can adjust the sample sizes according to their computational resources and analysis requirements.
